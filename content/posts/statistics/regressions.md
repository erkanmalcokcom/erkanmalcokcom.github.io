Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the response variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or explanatory variables).

Regression analysis can be used to analyze and predict the relationship between two or more variables by fitting a line or curve to the data. The goal is to find the best fitting model that explains the relationship between the variables.

There are two main types of regression analysis:

1. **Simple linear regression**: It involves a single independent variable and a dependent variable. It is used to model the relationship between the two variables using a straight line.

2. **Multiple linear regression**: It involves two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It is used to model the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables using a linear equation.
The regression analysis involves estimating the parameters of the regression model, such as the intercept and slope, using a set of observed data. Once the model is fitted to the data, it can be used to make predictions or estimate the values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

Regression analysis is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, social sciences, engineering, and healthcare to understand the relationship between variables and to make predictions based on the available data.
