# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that manages memory usage automatically. However, understanding how memory works in Python is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

In Python, memory is divided into two main parts: the stack and the heap. The stack is used to store simple data types such as integers, floats, and booleans. The heap is used to store more complex data types such as lists, dictionaries, and objects.

When you create a variable in Python, the interpreter assigns memory space for that variable on the stack. For simple data types, the value of the variable is stored directly in the memory location. For more complex data types, the variable contains a reference to a memory location in the heap where the actual data is stored.

When you modify the value of a variable, the interpreter creates a new object in memory and updates the variable to reference the new object. This means that Python does not modify objects in place but creates new objects as needed.

One important feature of Python's memory management is garbage collection. Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects in memory. Each object has a reference count, which is the number of variables that reference that object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, the garbage collector frees up the memory used by that object.

To optimise memory usage in Python, you can use techniques such as:

- Reusing objects instead of creating new ones whenever possible.
- Avoiding unnecessary copies of objects by using references or slices.
- Using generators and iterators instead of creating lists or other data structures that may consume a lot of memory.
- Deleting objects manually when they are no longer needed.

In summary, Python's memory management is automatic and relies on reference counting and garbage collection. Understanding how memory works in Python can help you write more efficient and bug-free code.
