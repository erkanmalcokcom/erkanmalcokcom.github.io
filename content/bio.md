# Hi, I'm Erkan.

The goal is to pursue a Data Science career, leveraging my mathematics, statistics, and programming expertise, after an extended period in advertising. I possess self-motivation, a diligent work ethic, and enthusiasm. My ability to learn rapidly and collaborate effectively in a team and an independent setting is a strength.

I am a skilled communicator who excels at explaining intricate concepts. I am attentive and can execute tasks well, following instructions attentively. Additionally, I excel in problem-solving and possess the ingenuity to find solutions proactively.

The ability to work under pressure while effectively managing expectations on complex subjects is something I possess. This is due to my skill in creating time for deep thinking and reflection on the information I have learned.

Engaging in deep thinking and contemplation about a particular topic or concept can enhance your ability to recall and access related knowledge when in a situation where you need it the most.

This process of reflection helps to solidify the information in your memory and makes it more easily retrievable when you need to apply it. 

Therefore, thinking and reflecting on important information is essential to ensure it is readily available and helpful when required. Take your time and consider multiple solutions. If you are motivated, you are more likely to succeed. Thinking about things makes it more likely that the knowledge will be more readily available when you need it most. 

When we are faced with a problem and need to recall what we have learned that we truly realize the extent of our knowledge. Our learning journey is ongoing and it is worrisome to assume that we have complete mastery over a topic and become overconfident.

# My approach to learning
* Stay away from every distraction especially TV, Social Media, etc. at least for two day.
* Start with a question that leads to an answer. Do not to stop questioning.
* Have more experience, it will help you to discover a creative way.
* Complexity contains simple rules. You cannot build a complex system in one day.
* Be confident about your goals. You are the one who can make it happen because it is your problem.
* Keep exploring until you find a pattern. If you cannot find a pattern, you are not ready to find a solution.
___

Learning is connecting dots, and at the end, you need another dot to connect.
When you start to answer a question, you will find another question. 
You need to answer that question to find another question. 

This process will continue until you find a solution. It depends on your curiosity, determination, resources and the size of problem. Small bites are better than big bites.

Thank you for your time.
