Start with a question that leads to an answer. Do not to stop questioning. Have more experience, it will help you to discover a creative way. Complexity contains simple rules. You cannot build a complex system in one day. Be confident about your goals. You are the one who can make it happen because it is your problem. Keep exploring until you find a pattern.
