[{"content":"In Python, a decorator is a function or a class that is used to modify the behavior of another function or class without changing its source code. A decorator takes a function or a class as input and returns a new function or class that adds some extra functionality to the original function or class.\nDecorators are typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, authentication, or performance monitoring, without having to modify the code of the original function or class.\nIn Python, a decorator is denoted by the \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo; symbol, followed by the name of the decorator function or class. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a simple decorator that adds a logging statement before and after a function call:\ndef my_decorator(func): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): print(\u0026#34;Before the function is called.\u0026#34;) result = func(*args, **kwargs) print(\u0026#34;After the function is called.\u0026#34;) return result return wrapper @my_decorator def my_function(): print(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;) my_function() In this example, the my_decorator function takes a function func as input, defines a new function wrapper that adds some logging statements, and then returns the wrapper function. The @my_decorator syntax is used to apply the decorator to the my_function function, effectively modifying its behavior by wrapping it with the wrapper function.\nWhen my_function() is called, it first prints \u0026ldquo;Before the function is called.\u0026rdquo;, then executes the original function code (which prints \u0026ldquo;Hello, world!\u0026rdquo;), and finally prints \u0026ldquo;After the function is called.\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://erkanmalcokcom.github.io/posts/python/what-is-decorator/","summary":"In Python, a decorator is a function or a class that is used to modify the behavior of another function or class without changing its source code.

A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.\nHow would you perform web scraping in Python? You can use the requests library or BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML of a web page.\nAre lookups faster with dictionaries or lists in Python? Lookups in dictionaries are faster than lookups in lists.\nHow familiar are you with TensorFlow? Keras? OpenCV? SciPy? TensorFlow is a library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. SciPy is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. What is the difference between a list and a tuple? A list is mutable, while a tuple is immutable.\nWhat is data smoothing and how do you do it? Data smoothing is the process of removing noise from data. You can do this by taking the average of a set of data points.\nFor what is NumPy used? What are its benefits? NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\nWhat is a cache database? And why would you use one? A cache database is a database that stores data in a cache. You would use one to improve the performance of your application.\nWhat are some primitive data structures in Python? What are some user-defined data structures? Some primitive data structures in Python are integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Some user-defined data structures are stacks, queues, and trees.\n","permalink":"https://erkanmalcokcom.github.io/posts/interview/python-interview-questions/","summary":"What is the difference between “is” and “==”? \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo; checks if two variables point to the same object, while == checks if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.\nWhat is a decorator?

The goal is to find the best fitting model that explains the relationship between the variables.\nThere are two main types of regression analysis:\nSimple linear regression: It involves a single independent variable and a dependent variable. It is used to model the relationship between the two variables using a straight line.\nMultiple linear regression: It involves two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It is used to model the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables using a linear equation. The regression analysis involves estimating the parameters of the regression model, such as the intercept and slope, using a set of observed data. Once the model is fitted to the data, it can be used to make predictions or estimate the values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\nRegression analysis is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, social sciences, engineering, and healthcare to understand the relationship between variables and to make predictions based on the available data.\n","permalink":"https://erkanmalcokcom.github.io/posts/statistics/regressions/","summary":"Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the response variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or explanatory variables).\nRegression analysis can be used to analyze and predict the relationship between two or more variables by fitting a line or curve to the data.
